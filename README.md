# Sudoku Algorithm
 A sudoku game which uses a backtracking algorithm to find the correct answers.
 This program allows the user to enter their guesses into the corresponding box and will return whether it is the correct answer. Pushing the space bar starts the backtracking algorithm for the program and the sudoku will solve itself.

The user can see the tiles changing as the backtracking algorithm is doing its work.
